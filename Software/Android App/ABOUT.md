## About the Android app
This app has been made with MIT App Inventor 2 ([ai2.appinventor.mit.edu](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu)).
The app have been tested on a Motorola Moto G 3 running on lineage OS 14.1, with a 5" display. The interface may or may not be different on other devices.

You can modify the app by importing the projet file (Wake_up_light.aia) to MIT App Inventor 2, or just install the app on your phone with the apk file (make sure you disabled the unknown sources protection on your phone's settings).
